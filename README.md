# SoulWorker JP WebClient Lite
This is a project to replace Internet Explorer's tasks for SoulWorker player.

# What can it do ?
0. This is only work for SoulWorker JP.
1. Able to login and launch the game directly without Internet Explorer.
    - This require user's trust because user have to login with Hangame's account. If you don't trust this. Do not use.
2. Able to manage patches
    - Currently i had hard-coded it to use English Patch only. "Devs" can edit this.

# Some more words:
1. For devs who edit or fork this, PLEASE DO NOT STEAL OTHERS' ACCOUNTS. It's just sad.
2. Please help me maintain and fix my dirty codes.
3. Thank you.
